					<h1>SUMMER VACATION</h1>

			<p>
				I had been eagerly looking forward to my summer vacation and the planned trip to Puri with my family. The idea of getting away from the busy life of the city and immersing ourselves in the tranquility of the coastal town was thrilling.

					After weeks of anticipation, the day finally arrived, and we embarked on our journey to Puri. I had packed all my favourite clothes and necessary items and was looking forward to the beautiful experiences that awaited us. As we reached the station, we were greeted by the delicious aroma of street food. We savoured a delightful veg thali and boarded the train with excitement. I was already feeling the anticipation of the journey as we made ourselves comfortable in our seats.
				</p>
				<p>
					The journey to Puri was an adventure in itself. The train whizzed past beautiful sceneries, and I was awed by the beauty of the coastal regions. I enjoyed reading the famous novel, ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ by Harper Lee, and eating scrumptious dahi puchkas as we sang songs in chorus. Finally, we arrived in Puri in the evening, and we were welcomed by the beautiful sight of the Bay of Bengal. We checked into our hotel called Sea View Residence, which lived up to its name as it offered a stunning view of the ocean.

					The next day, we headed to the Jagannath Temple, one of the most popular destinations in Puri. The temple was massive and awe-inspiring, with intricate carvings and sculptures that left us spellbound. As we wandered around, we learned about the story of Lord Jagannath and his siblings, Balabhadra and Subhadra.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legend has it that Lord Jagannath was the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu, who was born to rid the world of evil. Balabhadra and Subhadra were his siblings, and together they ruled the world. The story goes that the siblings were once humiliated by a devotee, and in response, they hid their faces behind a curtain. The curtain remained in place for years until it was discovered by a pious king who built the Jagannath Temple. As we absorbed the story and history of the temple, we were moved by the spiritual energy and devotion that surrounded us.

					After visiting the temple, we made our way to the beach, and the sight was breath-taking. The waves were high and magnificent, and the sand was pristine. We swam, sunbathed, and took in the beauty of the surroundings. We clicked several pictures to preserve the memories of the trip. The seafood we had was amazing, and we savoured every bite. We also went shopping and bought traditional toys and beach hats, along with famous sweets called Khaja.

					As our trip came to an end, we felt grateful for the beautiful experiences we had shared as a family. We returned back to the City of Joy, Kolkata our home with a sense of rejuvenation and a newfound appreciation for the simple things in life.
