# blu-codebook

Welcome to my codebook repository! This is where I document my coding journey and share my progress with the world.

## About

This repository contains a collection of programs, projects, and notes that I've created as I learn to code. Most of them were written by me when I was in school so don't mind the poor code, documentation and indentation. I'll be updating it regularly with new content, so be sure to check back often!

## Contents

- [Code Snippets](./code-snippets)
- [Projects](./projects)
- [Notes](./notes)

## License

This repository is licensed under the [GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v-3.0](./LICENSE).

## Contributing

I'd really appreciate if you make improvements to my programs or add some documentation. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome!
